# Password Generator

## Description
Created a JavaScript powered random password generator. User will initiate the application by clicking the generate button which then will start a series of prompts that will determine the included characters in the generatered password. The only criteria users need to meet to utilize the application is that password length be at least 8 characters long but less than 128. Password will be displayed to page and User can copy the text to use. Please note that typing anything other than a number in the initial prompt will result in all other prompts to be initiated but the generated password will only be four randomly generated characters.
